# Digital Logic Design – FPGA Project

This repository contains the final submission for a university project in **Digital Logic Design**, developed using **VHDL** and **Xilinx Vivado**.

## 📘 Project Overview

The goal of the project was to design and implement a digital system on an **FPGA** to solve a specific problem provided as part of a university assignment. The problem description and the detailed design process are documented in the report included in this repository.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `project.vhd`:  
  This is the main VHDL source file submitted for evaluation.  
  > ⚠️ *Note:* For the purpose of submission, the entire design was merged into a single VHDL file. Originally, each component had its own dedicated file.

- `report.pdf`:  
  A detailed report describing:
  - The original problem statement
  - The design choices
  - The system architecture
  - Simulation and verification processes

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Xilinx Vivado** – for VHDL development and simulation  
- **VHDL** – hardware description language used for all components

## 📄 How to Use

To simulate or synthesize the project:

1. Open **Vivado**
2. Create a new project
3. Import the `project.vhd` file
4. Run simulation or synthesis as needed

## 📚 Notes

- This repository is intended to serve as a record of the design and submission process.
- The `report.pdf` file essentially serves as an extended README with in-depth technical details.
